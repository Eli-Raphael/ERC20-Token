# ERC20 Token 

## Description

The ERC20 Token is a contract where the owner alone is able to mint tokens but for other processes such as burning and transferring of tokens, any account can take part.

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. 

Go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/ then create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the Compile "ERC20 Token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, click "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "ERC20 Token.sol" contract from the dropdown menu, type in the name that you want for the contract and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Proceed to the dropdown of whatever you have named your contract to interact with the user interface that will let you call on the different functions in here. If you want to test the three requirements:
1. Only the owner can mint tokens.
2. Any account can burn tokens.
3. Any account can transfer tokens.

Be mindful of the account that you are using, it may get confusing at times. Be sure that you have copied the right account as well to avoid getting confused.

Notes:
To change accounts, click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" and click on the "Accounts" Drop down to select an account to use for minting, burning, and transferring. To copy the account code, click the button furthest from the "Accounts" label above the dropdown, copy it to the text box beside mint or burn to use that account for a specific function.
